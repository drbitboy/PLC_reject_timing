  - Updated ~2023-07-19T10:30:00 EDT
    - Removed the restriction on encoder pulse frequencies above 1183Hz
    - Default configuration:
      - USE_ENCODER = 0
        - Runs a time-based reject model
      - LOSPEED_OFFSET_SP = 1700
        - bit array index for zero speed (theoretical)
        - For time-based model, reject solenoid signal fires
          - ~1700ms (1.7s) after inspection fail event
        - For encoder-based model, reject solenoid signal fires
          - ~(1700*25) encoder pulses after inspection fail event
            - at encoder pulse frequency of 0Hz (theoretical)
            - = (LOSPEED_OFFSET_SP*ENCODER_HIPRESET_SP)
          - ~(990*25) encoder pulses after inspection fail event
            - at encoder pulse frequency of 1183Hz (linespeed = 710 ???-per-minute)
            - = (HISPEED_OFFSET_SP*ENCODER_HIPRESET_SP)
      - HISPEED_OFFSET_SP = 990
        - bit array index for 710 "linespeed" ???-per-minute
          - â‰¡encoder pulse frequency of 1183.333Hz
      - ENCODER_HIPRESET_SP = 25
        - Pulse/frequency divisor, sets number of pulses per bit array element
        - 2000Hz/(25pulse/element) = 80element/s
      - REJECTOR_DURATION_SP = 75
        - Reject pusher solenoid dwell time, ms

      - Pulse/Frequency divider in place (ENCODER_HIPRESET_SP)
      - Warning if pulse-divided edges are closer than two scan cycles
      - Linespeed calculation is exponentially filtered instead of using a moving average

## 20230714_Conveyor_Reject_Micro820-QBB.ccwarc
- Latest version is in commit [d2f297e](https://github.com/drbitboy/PLC_reject_timing/tree/d2f297ec6200262c4a4a4fb18605095bc3468c88/versions)
- First cut at port of reject code from MicroLogix 1100/RSLogix 500 to Micro820/CCW
  - No HSC code yet
  - All variables to be interfaced with the GUI/HMI are in Global Variables with their original names
    - e.g. LOSPEED_OFFSET_SP not N17:1
